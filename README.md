This program runs to create a simulation of a traffic intersection with traffic lights, crosswalk buttons, a crosswalk buzzer, and an emergency traffic light override button. 

This program requires a circuit created on a breadboard (refer to Diagrams folder for a schematic diagram and a TinkerCAD image) and a micro:bit that must be connected to the breadboard with a micro:bit edge connector. The micro:bit should also be connected to a laptop or computer via the given USB cable for the micro:bit to work.

Example breadboard with micro:bit, micro:bit edge connector, and electrical components:

This project was accomplished with a partner, Celina Wang.
